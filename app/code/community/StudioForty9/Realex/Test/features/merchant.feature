Feature: Backend Messaging
   Given I have created an order using Realex as the payment method
   When I view this order in the backend
   Then I should see the last 4 digts of the credit card number
   And I should not see the entire credit card number
   And I should not see the CVC number
   #@todo what other information should be shown
